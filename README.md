# MODEL-SERVICE

Contains the wrapper service for the ML model.

Fetch a trained ML model from somewhere.
Embed the ML model in a Flask webservice, so it can be queried via REST.
Use the same pre-processing for the data that was used for training.
The webservice is containerized and released on GitHub through a workflow.
The image is versioned automatically, e.g., through release tags.
